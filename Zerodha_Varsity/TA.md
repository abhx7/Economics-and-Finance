# Technical Analysis

# Highlights

- Similarities between stock markets crash of 1929 and 2008 - Markets were at an all time high before the crash; DJIA loss
- Developing a point of view = Expected reward + Expected holding period + Risk involved + Price to buy and sell stocks (using Technical Analysis)
- Analysing stocks based on market participant actions and price stock chart = Technical Analysis
  - Also helps in identifying entry and exit points.
  - Visualizes the actions of market participants in the form of stock charts
  - Patterns are formed within the charts, and these patterns help a trader identify trading opportunities.
  - Works best when we keep a few core assumptions in perspective.
  - TA is used best to identify short term trades. 
- **Assumptions of Technical Analysis**
  - Markets discount everything
  - The how is more important than why
  - Price moves in trends
  - History tends to repeat itself
-----------------
- Setting Realistic Expectations 
  - Nifty CGAR Return to decide realistic expectations
  - Opportunities don't come by daily; Everyday does not give profits
  - Setting Expectations
    - Trades 
    - Returns per trade (smaller side from TA)
    - Holding period (few minutes to weeks or months)
    - Risk management : Trade means Entry and Exit intent, exit when trade goes against (like Stop Loss)
------------
-  Chart Types
  -  Line chart, let's say plotting closing prices for each day; it shows the general trend but the in-day prie fluctuation is missing
  -  To fix this we have the OLHC bar chart; over long term, it might be straining to look at in-day price change
  -  Candlestick chart - if it's a bullish day (up), the bar is green and for a bearish day (down), the bar is red; bar is the space between open and close price
-------------
- Timeframes - Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Intrday (most used ones)
  - Monthly is used by Investors for long term as you can see the overall trend throguh decades (12 candle bars a year)
  - Weekly is used by Investor or  Positional Traders, it can also give a bit of overall trend (52 candle bars a year)
  - Daily is used by Swing traders (about 252 candles per year)
  - Intraday is divided in 20 min, 15 min and 5 min
  - Lower the time frame, more is the information and the candles
  - Multi timeframe usage to develop a good pov as the trend can be different across the timeframes
----------
- Key Assumptions of Technical Analsysis
  - Market discounts everything (before it happens in anticipation of some news)
  - How is more important than why (Technical analysis is reactionary)
  - Price moves in trends
  - History tends to repeat itself
  - 
  - Hammer pattern (more buying interest insipte of huge selling; usually in short term this means it'll keep growing)
