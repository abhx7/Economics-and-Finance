# Technical Analysis

# Highlights

**Introduction to Technical Analysis**
- Similarities between stock markets crash of 1929 and 2008 - Markets were at an all time high before the crash; DJIA loss
- Developing a point of view = Expected reward + Expected holding period + Risk involved + Price to buy and sell stocks (using Technical Analysis)
- Analysing stocks based on market participant actions and price stock chart = Technical Analysis
  - Also helps in identifying entry and exit points.
  - Visualizes the actions of market participants in the form of stock charts
  - Patterns are formed within the charts, and these patterns help a trader identify trading opportunities.
  - Works best when we keep a few core assumptions in perspective.
  - TA is used best to identify short term trades. 
- **Assumptions of Technical Analysis**
  - Markets discount everything
  - The how is more important than why
  - Price moves in trends
  - History tends to repeat itself
-----------------
**Setting Realistic Expectations** 
  - Nifty CGAR Return to decide realistic expectations
  - Opportunities don't come by daily; Everyday does not give profits
  - Setting Expectations
    - Trades 
    - Returns per trade (smaller side from TA)
    - Holding period (few minutes to weeks or months)
    - Risk management : Trade means Entry and Exit intent, exit when trade goes against (like Stop Loss)
------------
**Chart Types**
  -  Line chart, let's say plotting closing prices for each day; it shows the general trend but the in-day prie fluctuation is missing
  -  To fix this we have the OLHC bar chart; over long term, it might be straining to look at in-day price change
  -  Candlestick chart - if it's a bullish day (up), the bar is green and for a bearish day (down), the bar is red; bar is the space between open and close price
-------------
- **Timeframes** - Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Intrday (most used ones)
  - Monthly is used by Investors for long term as you can see the overall trend throguh decades (12 candle bars a year)
  - Weekly is used by Investor or  Positional Traders, it can also give a bit of overall trend (52 candle bars a year)
  - Daily is used by Swing traders (about 252 candles per year)
  - Intraday is divided in 20 min, 15 min and 5 min
  - Lower the time frame, more is the information and the candles
  - Multi timeframe usage to develop a good pov as the trend can be different across the timeframes
----------
**Key Assumptions of Technical Analsysis**
  - Market discounts everything (before it happens in anticipation of some news)
  - How is more important than why (Technical analysis is reactionary)
  - Price moves in trends
  - History tends to repeat itself
  - 
  - Hammer pattern (more buying interest insipte of huge selling; usually in short term this means it'll keep growing)
-----
**Single Candlestick patterns** {NEED TO GO OVER THIS]
  - 1. Marubozu (no or little upper and lower shadow, closing or opening prices are average of the last bit of time relative to the time frame being discussed)
      - Bullish - open = low, close = high; green
      - Bearish - open = high, close =  low; red
  - If bullish marubozu in an uptrend could mean its getting stronger same for bearish marubozu in downtrend, as well as vice versa
  - Uptrend/Bullish - Buyers overpower seller, increase in demand
  - 2. Paper Umbrella 
         - Hammer -  bullish in downtrend ; small body and long wick below;( its a reversal pattern expectation indicator)
         - Hanging Man - bullish in uptrend; small body and long wick below;
   - How to trade? Example, if after hammer, the price goes below its low, then hammer didnt work vice versa for hanging man
  - 3. Shooting Star - Hammer inverted, bearish in an uptrend; small body and long wick upper; ( its a reversal pattern expectation indicator)
       - How to trade? Example, if it goes below the low after then reversal liekly to happend and if price goes above hgih, then shooting star has failed
----
**Multiple Candlestick patterns**
  -  Engulfing pattern (2 candlestick) - reversal pattern indicator, englulfs the previous day body (if also the wick is engulfed, much stronger)
     - Bullish - D2 Open < D1 Cloe, D2 Close > D1 Open, previously bearish
     - Bearish - - D2 Open > D1 Cloe, D2 Close < D1 Open, previously bullish
     - How to trade? (Watch the video)
   - Piercing Pattern (2 candlestick) - bearish pattern ongoing, start market gaps down a bit but then bull gain slgiht control but doesn't engulf, a reversal indicator
   - Dark Cloud Cover (2 candlestick) - bullish pattern ongoing, start market gaps up a bit but bears gain slgiht control but doesn't engulf, a reversal indicator
   - Morning Star (3 candlestick) - prior down trend, first bearish bar, 2nd bar is doji or spinning top, D3 closes above/near D1 open , now bulls in control
   - Evening Star (3 candlestick) - prior up trend, first bullish  bar, 2nd bar is doji or spinning top, D3 closes below/near D1 open , now bears in control
-----
**Support and Resistance** 
- Zones of excessive buying and selling with respect to the region before it
- This works better onn a high timeframe and no need for candlestick pattern here as line chart is good enough
- Support zone (needs 2 points atleast) is region of buying preference or bulls take over when market hits this region
- Resistance zone is region of selling preference
- Breakout if its able to break free from support and resistance zone and rises
- From the perspectice of a trader, buying and selling decisions can be decided based on support and resistance zones defined
-----
**Indicators**
- Why are indicators so popular? Quantitative to nature, Easy to plot
- Indicator is basically a calculation derived from price based on some hypothesis (near/far from average price, less/more momentum, overbought/oversold)
- Overlay - Bollinger bands, Moving average
- Underlay - Relative Strength Indicator (RSI), Moving Average Covergence Divergence (MACDi)
- Oscillators have overbought (some downward fall next) and overosold (some retracement now) area
- Moving average
  - Moving average gets  smoother when we take more points
  - Exponenential moving average - latest price is more relevant, gives running moving average and reacts to atest trends
  - If price over moving average, market is bullish and if below, market is bearish
  - IT should be taken for larger time period
- Moving Average Covergence Divergence (MACD)
  - Reliable momentum indicator; EMA recent data get more weightage than old
  - 12 EMA and 26 EMA are subtracted to get a value for MACD; MACD histogram easier to see trends
  - 9 EMA line
  - MACD Crossunder is the 2 lines meet together moving downwards and vice versa
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - It's a leading indicator and measures momentum
  - Overbought (over 70) and oversold (below 30) zones; range of values between 0 to 100
  - If overbought, we expect it too fall and vice versa
  - Disadvantage of stickiness, if it becomes overbought/oversold it'll stick to one value at the top and not retrace
----
**Moving Averages (Indicators)**
- Indicators are nice because htey give numbers upon which buying/selling decision can be taken; we will develop a simple system based on moving average for such buying/selling decisions
- Use exponential averages MA50 (faster) and MA100 (slower); Buy when MA50 over MA 100 and sell when MA50 dips below MA100; examples in vid are useful to understand
- CONS
  - No Stoploss or Target
  - Won't work as good in Sideways Market
- PROS
  - Indicator based
  - Clear Entry and Exit
  - Quantified
  - Will work in Strong Tredning Market
- Hold on to winners for a long time, try to lose to loosers wuickly; few big winners usually and most of the rest no profit or little loss
- EMA - Outlook : 9/21 - Daily; 25/50 - Weekly; 50-100 - Monthly; 100/200 - Yearly
  (Key takeaways are important)
----  
**Your trading checklist**
- Timeframe selection ( Time frame - Time period)
  - Intraday - 30 min, 15 min (don't use this as a beginner)
  - Short Term - Daily
  - Long Term - Weekly
- Trader type and their Lookback period (e.g. for Support and Rest Zones) 
  - Scalper : 3-5 days
  - Swing : 3 months
  - Investor : Years
- Universe (what stocks are you looking for)
  - How to pick stocks? (good starting point is to restrict to NIFTY50/100
  - Tradestocks which are liquid and high volume (blue chips)
  - Don't trade operator driven stocks or low volume stocks or unknown companies
- Bring it all together (Refer to Section 19.5 - The Scout)
