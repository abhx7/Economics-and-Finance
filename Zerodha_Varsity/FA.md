**Understanding the P&L statement**
- P&L statement is a representation of the company's revenue recognised, expenses, tax they had to pay and profit they took home for that financial year
- Revenue recognised is usually the top line; Other income comprise of non-operating activities, dividend income, interest income, etc.
- Associaed note gives more details about what that line item represents; do look at it to udnerstand the nature of revenue/expense generation
- Expenses include raw material cost, salaary paid to employees, depreciation and amortization, interest payments, electricity and rent, power and advertisement, etc
- Operating Profit = Revenue - Expenses
- PAT (Final Profit) = Profit - Tax; also called the bottom line of the company
- Don't just look at PAT, look at expense and revenue

**Understanding balance sheet**
- Consolidated balance sheet is on a year on year basis, carryover from previous year unlike P&L
- Assets and Liabilities, Non current and Current for each
- Assets
  - Non Current : usually long term economic benefit like property, plant and machinery as well as intangible assets like trademarks and patents, financial investments like government bonds or mutual funds
  - Current : economic output within a year like inventories (fnished goods to be sold), trade receivables like payments from vendors and customers or loan repayments
  - notice the large line items in assets; dig through them further through associated notes
- Liabilities
  - liability in simple terms is a financial obligation of a company 
  - Non Current : can be fulfilled within a few years
  - Current : has to be fulfilled within a year
  - Equity 
    -  Share Capital : money that the promoters and early investors put into the company
    -  Reserves and surpluses : profits flowing from P&L statement, this money earmarked by company to use are here
---
**The Cash Flow statement**
- states the cash position of the company
- to use this, we need to understand the different activities of company; each of these activities either generate or use cash and we get final cash statement by summing these
  - Operating Activities : good company should be geenrating money from this, for eg manufacture products using input raw materials and sell the finished goods
  - Investing : all capital expenditure to grow its business like investing in new plants and new machinery
    - negative/consumes - reinvesting in itself
    - positive - prolly selling off its assets
  - Financing : such as borrowing from banks or paying dividends
    - positive means borrowing fresh capital to fund its working capital or capex
    - negative is repaying loan or giving out dividends
- some insights from example
  - if variable operating activities cost is a red flag
  - where is money coming from to invest in itself, cost of borrowing (i.e. the interest on borrowing) is more than operating cost than is a red flag
  - green flag when operating cash is high and stable, part of it is invested and part to dividens; we know its dividends since there is a lot of surplus cash from operations - can look  into this company further
