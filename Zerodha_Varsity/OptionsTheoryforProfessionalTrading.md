# Options Theory for Professional Trading

**Introduction to Options**
- Price can move in 3 ways - increase, decrease or stay the same
- In example, person A pays a non refundable fee person B bounding him to an obligation of selling the land in 6 months time if he decides to buy it (if the road project happens, land becomes more valuable) ; if land price increases, he will want to buy at decided price; if price decreases, he will not buy it and forfeits the premium paid; if price doesnt change, he will not buy and again premium paid is a profit to buyer; this is exactly
- Options are leveraged instruments
- While trading options, a buyer pays a small amount of money (premium) to controls a large amount of position
- Timing, speed and direction of the trade needs to be right in order to make money

**Long Call Payoff and Short Call Trade**
- profitability of a call option for a buyer and seller
- 3 cases to consider - stock price rallies, remains the same and declines
- Stock price rallies is only situation for profit, if price remains same or declines, buyer will lose the premium paid and will be in a loss
- Buy call option when you are bullish on the underlying until expiry
- Long call payoff chart, max loss is restricted to premium paid, breaking point is when there is no loss or profit (= strike pric + premium paid)
- max loss of buyer is max profit, but breaking point stay same; the payoff chart is inverted so loss can keep on increasing if price drops for seller
