## Highlights

**Introduction to forwards market**
- Forward contract
- A derivative is a financia security with a ccalue that is reliant upon, or derived from, an undelying assest or group of assets (stock, currency, bond or commodity)
- Futures contract
- Derivatives - Futures and Options
- A forwards contract is the agreement between 2 people, a buyer and a seller; the transaction takes place sometime in the future so price could have changed on that day of transaction
- Risk involved in forwards agreement - counter party risk due to volatility of prices and liquidity risk if seller doesn't have the commodity being bought

**Introduction to futures contract**
- Futures contracts are standardised and there is a regulator so that the parties involved fulfill their obligations
  - Forwards : Customised, High counterparty Risk, Unregulated
  - Futures - Standardised, Low Counterparty Risk, Regulated
- Underlying is the commodty being trading (for e.g., commodity, index, currency, index)
- Lot size is the minimum number of underlying you trade on
- Contract size is the total price of the underlying being traded
- Expiry is when obligations have to be completed for the contract (for e.g., weekly, monthly, etc)
- Margin is the percentage of contract size you pay beforehand
- Underlying is also calld the spot price

**Margins**
- Anyone entering a contract must put up money; this is the reason why brokers charge money to prevent risk of default, usually a percentage of contract
- Margin is divided into span and exposure; both mandated by stock exchange ; this is calculated (3 times a day) based on volatility
- Margin has to be maintained by the broker
- While buying the futures cntract, you need to buy/sell in multiples of minimum lot and the margin required to be put up is shown or you can calculate it on your own
- Current, middle and far month contracts are usually seen with regards to expiry of contracts
- Short will have high margin due to high risk and vice versa for long

**Leverage and Payoff**
- Leverage
  - Buy an asset worth a lot of money, usually asset is being made (like a building on plot), some margin(lets say 10 lakhs) is paid to the builder to block the plot, if asset value (initially lets say 1cr) grows, some other buyer may approach you to buy it for a higher amount (lets say 1.2 cr), that would give a great profit (so 100% profit, as 20 lakh profit on 10 lakh margin put up)
  - small amount of money to controla  much larger asset, all profit loss calculated on actual asset value and not on the margin put up, so the return on investmnets could be very high
  - in context of stock, lets take an example of contract value 10 lakh and margin of 1 lakh, leverage is calculated using contract value by margin, so here it is 10x. every unit movement in underlying, the movement is profit and loss is that times.
  - 1/levreage will tell that amount of movement against your position will wipe out your entire margin
  - stay away your leverage if you are a beginner
- Payoff
  - visual representation of when you break even, make a profit or loss
  - futrues payoff structure is linear; non linear are possible for other investment types
  - long futures and short futures are mirror images
  - futures investment are zero-sum game, one person's gain is another persons' loss

**Futures trade**
- Futures need to be enabled in account as it's a seperate segment on stock exchange
- Actually simple - add to watchlist and buy
- you should actually have some excess of margin amount when making futures treade
- Order won't execute unless it matches with someones sell order, so you cant still modify your order based on mamrket dept
- Live P&L is shown once order is executed; Average Price - Last Traded Price - Profit; so, Profit x Quantity = Mark to Market (P&L)
- In Overnight position of M2M, there's a daily M2M profit or loss which gets debited or credited unlike intra-day position. Also overnight position also requires excess other than margin.

**Setllement**
- Settlement occurs after expiry of contract when buyer and seller fulfill their obligations and transaction occurs
- Physical settlement that happenned earlier is like buying gold by giving money discussed earlier in the module
- Setllement price is closing price on expiry date, like of share price on that day
- Margin keeps increaing closer to expiry date as its nearing physical delivery and goes beyond span and exposure (varsity notes heck)
- Physical settlements happens only in stock not indices
- You should have the money(stock futures)  or have the shares (short futures) depending on if buyer or seller near the expiry date or you should exit your position
- Cash settlement is only money transaction and no exchange of underlying; for e.g., one person is long a company's stock and the other person, the short seller has to pay you if settlement price is higher than original 
- Index derivatives are cash settles
- Usually exit before expiry cuz traders usually dont have the stocks or moneys, so no hassle to worry about settlements
---
**Open Interest**
- an example, ine one contract person A wants to go long and person B want to short, similarly another person C wants to go long so another contract; currently OI is 2 and volume is 2; if one sells, then OI decreases but volume increases (square off = transaction occurs)
- more positions created OI Buid up, if people exit their positions then OI Unwindining
- OI increases or decrease and Volume only increases, counting starts at start of day
- There is a limit of number of contracts that can exist in any security, once it hit 95% of that limit (Market Wide Position Limit) ; the exchange does not allow any new contracts called contract ban period but exisiting players can exit positions
- Exchange lists what companies are under a ban period at that time
- Circuits (or Dynamic Price range) are price bands set up to prevent large movements in a single day
- Halt trading for 15min (cooling period) if 10% movement occurs, next price range/circuit 5% then again a cooling of period is there and then resumes
